## Bubble\-Gravity

### Description

A screensaver and a simple simulation all in one. Little (or big) 'bubbles' bounce around the screen, following the laws of gravity and force. Each 'bubble' has a mass and velocity, and are affected by Gravity and Wind. You can change the gravity and wind, as well as changing the mass of an individual 'bubble' or applying a thrust to it. There are a lot of key commands, so press F1 while it's running if you're not sure what to do.

btw, if you look really carefully, it's not entirely accurate: but it's more than good enough for a screensaver, that's for sure :)
